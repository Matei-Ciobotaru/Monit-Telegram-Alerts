# Sending Monit alerts via Telegram

A simple python 2.7 script I wrote so I may send [Monit](https://mmonit.com/monit/) alerts via Telegram.

## Python Libraries

You will require the [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) library to use Telegram, the other 2 libraries (os and logging) used in the script are standard.

## Telegram Bot

You will need to create a Telegram bot and edit the python script to add your personal token and chatid.

Details on how to create a bot [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot).

## Description

**monit_2_telegram.py**<br>

By default, Monit uses a set of environment variables to store details of the alert which it sends via email.
This script grabs the output of the aformentioned variables, formats them for readability and sends them via Telegram.
It also writes its output in Monit's defautlt log ('/var/log/monit.log') using the same format for debugging purposes.

**monitrc**<br>

 This is an extract from my Monit instance's configuration file, which shows how to set Telegram alerts for a service.

**monit.log**<br>

 An extract of the Monit log containing the Telegram alert script lines.
